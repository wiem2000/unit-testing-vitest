# Unit Testing with Vitest

This repository contains examples of implementing unit tests in JavaScript with Vitest, along with instructions for running tests and checking code coverage.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate the use of Vitest for writing effective unit tests for JavaScript functions. Tests are used to verify the proper functioning of various parts of our code, ensuring the quality and reliability of our application.

## Project Content

- **src/**: This directory contains the source files of our project, including the functions to be tested.
- **tests/**: This directory contains unit test files for our JavaScript functions. Each test file corresponds to a function or a set of related functions.
- **package.json**: This file contains the dependencies of our project as well as scripts for running unit tests and checking code coverage.

## Features

This project includes the following features:

- Implementation of unit tests for JavaScript functions using Vitest.
- Verification of expected results using assertions.
- Execution of unit tests using npm commands.

## Running Tests

To run unit tests, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run test
```
This will run the unit tests and display the results in your terminal.

## Checking Code Coverage
You can also check code coverage using the following command:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```
This will run the tests with code coverage enabled and display the coverage rate in your terminal.

## Viewing Test Reports
To further understand the test executions and coverage reports, refer to the **Compte rendu TP1.pdf** file. It contains screenshots capturing the test runs and coverage analysis for your reference.
